# inventory-app (nodejs)

## technologies used
Mongodb with Mongoose as database and Pug as a template engine.

## accomplishments
The thing I'm most proud of in this project is the code organization which surpassed
any of my last products. I also am happy with the image upload integration which was only optional on the asignment.
