# inventory-app (nodejs)

## Technologies 
Mongodb with Mongoose as database and Pug as a template engine.

## Accomplishments
The thing I'm most proud of in this project is the code organization which surpassed   
any of my last projects (route, model, and controller).  
I also am happy with the image upload integration which was only optional on the asignment.
